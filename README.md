Run WireMock as part of Maven lifecycle.

## Quick start guide

- Add your mock definitions to the following folders:

```
src/main/resources/mappings/
src/main/resources/__files/
```

- Add this plugin to your **pom.xml**:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>io.buildlogic</groupId>
            <artifactId>wiremock-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version><!-- check above badge for most recent version of wiremock-maven-plugin --></version>

            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>run</goal>
                        <goal>stop</goal> <!-- important in multi-module project where more than one module uses this plugin -->
                    </goals>
                    <configuration>
                        <dir>target/classes</dir>
                        <params>--port=8081 --verbose</params>
                        <skip>false</skip> <!-- set to true to skip plugin execution -->
                    </configuration>
                </execution>
            </executions>
            <dependencies>
                <dependency>
                    <groupId>org.wiremock</groupId>
                    <artifactId>wiremock</artifactId>
                    <version><!-- wiremock version you want to use --></version>
                </dependency>
            </dependencies>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

See [WireMock manual](https://wiremock.org/docs/standalone/java-jar/) for detailed information on available command line
options.

- Run your tests:

`mvn clean verify`

Maven will copy your resources from `src/main/resources/` to `target/classes/`. WireMock Maven Plugin will start
WireMock on `localhost:8081` at `pre-integration-test` phase and use your mock definitions. Your tests executed
at `integration-test` phase will have mocks ready to use. When Maven process execution finishes, WireMock will be
stopped as well.

You may want to stop WireMock Maven Plugin explicitly in `post-integration-test` phase instead of waiting for it to shut
down at the end of Maven process execution. You can do that by adding `stop` goal to the configuration. See above code
snippet as an example. This will help you avoid port conflicts in multi-module Maven projects with more than one module
using this plugin.

See [pom.xml](https://github.com/ipastusi/wiremock-maven-plugin/blob/master/src/it/core/pom.xml) for a simple
example and [pom.xml](https://github.com/ipastusi/wiremock-maven-plugin/blob/master/src/it/ext/pom.xml) for an
example with WireMock extension.

If you want to start and stop WireMock manually, but prefer Maven to download it for you, this is how you can configure
your project:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>io.buildlogic</groupId>
            <artifactId>wiremock-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version><!-- wiremock-maven-plugin version - check maven central badge above for most recent released version number --></version>

            <configuration>
                <keepRunning>true</keepRunning>
                <dir>target/classes</dir>
                <params>--port=8081 --verbose</params>
            </configuration>

            <dependencies>
                <dependency>
                    <groupId>org.wiremock</groupId>
                    <artifactId>wiremock</artifactId>
                    <version><!-- wiremock version you want to use --></version>
                </dependency>
            </dependencies>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

Now when you run it with `mvn clean compile wiremock:run`, you should see the following line in the console output:

```
[INFO] WireMock will keep running until interrupted manually...
```

## Supported Java versions

WireMock Maven Plugin is tested against Java LTS versions 11 and 17.
